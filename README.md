I have zero expirence and just started to go beyond videos games lol. 

cd Interest/int.txt/

I just recently stumbled across a guy on youtube and it sparked me to want to know more.
I love to research and go down rabbit holes so this fits my personality lol. I've been
playing around with a few basic things like html and css (which im starting to think was
a waste of time). I have started learning python and linux and im falling inlove lol. 

cd Goals/future.txt/

I decided to enroll in my local community college for computer science but I think Cyber
Secruity would be better for me. The qualifications for CS seem to be a little bit 
higher than Soft Dev but I thinnk I still might do it. Well my semster starts in Sept.
2022 so wish me luck .


#please don't mind my terrible way to use linux commands and I know its probably wrong 
but I like to take every opp to use what im studying.
